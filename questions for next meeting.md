if we implement a "save as favorite" function, how would we best model that in the ontology? do we just add a _informable_ field like "favorite": [true, false] / ["yes", "no"]?


should we summarize prep time into classes like "less than 15 minutes"? do we even need to include the values for the prep time in the ontology?
